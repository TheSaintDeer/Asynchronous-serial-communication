# Asynchronous-serial-communication
Project by subject INC (Design of digital systems)

The aim of the project is to acquire basic skills in the design and implementation of digital circuits. Learn how to describe these circuits in VHDL and gain experience with their simulations using the Modelsim tool. For simplicity, we will implement only a selected part of this controller, more specifically, we will focus on the receiving part responsible for processing data from the serial line and their reconstruction (parallelization). In contrast to the full-value UART controller, we will consider a number of other simplifications so that the overall complexity of the project does not exceed the tolerable limit.
